# Basic Workflow

Small starter example. Shows a single workflow with a manual trigger and a few simple steps. Good first stop if you are new to GitHub Actions.

## What it shows

- Manual dispatch trigger
- Basic job with ordered steps
- Simple echo logging

## Why it exists

Sets the pattern used in the other folders. Nothing fancy on purpose.

## Next

Look at `job-dependencies` after this one.
